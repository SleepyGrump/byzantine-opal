|detail=These commands allow players and staffers to administer channels. Most of them can only be done by players who own a channel. We will be using the Public channel for an example channel when called for.
|example=
* Appearance:
** '''pub/header <header>''' - set the header text with color - <Public> vs (Public) vs _Public_. You'll want something that stands out without being an eyesore.
** '''pub/desc <description>''' - change the description.
** '''pub/alias <alias>''' - change the default alias - the auto-guesser doesn't always get it right.
* Behavior:
** '''pub/spoof''' - set a channel spoofable (anonymous)
** '''pub/nospoof''' - set a channel non-spoofable (not anonymous)
** '''pub/notitle''' - restrict comtitles
** '''pub/yestitle''' - unrestrict comtitles
** '''pub/loud''' - set a channel noisy (emits connects/disconnects)
** '''pub/quiet''' - set a channel quiet (no connects/disconnects)
