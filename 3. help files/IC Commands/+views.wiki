|topic=+views
|detail=Views are descriptions of specific details on objects or people that aren't included in the main description. A good use of a view might be to describe a bar's regulars or bartender, to set its menu, or to describe a specific piece of clothing on your character which someone might want to examine in detail. Views are automatically visible to everyone who types +view.
|example=
* '''+view''' - see available views in your area. If there's only one, you will view it.
* '''+view <target>''' - see views on a player or a location.
* '''+view <target>/<view>''' - see a specific view on an object or player.
* '''+view/add <target>/<title>=<view>''' - create a view. Use %R for line breaks and %T for tab indents.
* '''+view/delete <target>/<title>''' - delete a view.
