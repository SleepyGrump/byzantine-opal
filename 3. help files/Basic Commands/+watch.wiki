|topic=+watch
|detail=+watch is just a slightly specialized function of +who. You'll be notified when the player you +watch logs in, unless they're hiding from +watch.
|example=
* '''+watch/list''' - list all the people you're watching
* '''+watch''' - see just the people you have watched
* '''+watch/add <name>''' - watch someone's connections/disconnections
* '''+watch/delete <name>''' - stop watching them
* '''+watch/hide''' - hide from +watch
* '''+watch/unhide''' - become visible to +watch again. Will not notify players that you've connected.
* '''+watch/permit <name>''' - permit someone to see you log in even when you're hiding.
* '''+watch/unpermit <name>''' - revoke someone's permission to +watch you while you're hiding.
* '''+watch/all on or off''' - see all logins and disconnects.
* '''+watch/on or /off''' - turn connect/disconnect notices on or off entirely.
* '''+watch/page <message>''' - page all your watched players who are connected a message.

==== Advanced commands: ====

Change how +watch messages look with code like this:

&watchfmt me=cat(alert(prettytime()), moniker(%0), has, %1.)

For backwards compatibility, we also include &awatch:

&awatch me=think My &awatch: %0 has %1.
