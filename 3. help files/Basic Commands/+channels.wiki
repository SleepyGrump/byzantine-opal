|topic=+channels
|detail=Channels are for discussing specific topics. They can be either OOC or IC, though normally they're OOC. Topics might include things like game rules, character generation, or just a public hangout for everyone to enjoy.

	Our game allows each player to make their own channel to share with their friends, which can be public or private as the player chooses.
|example=
* '''+channels''' - see a list of available channels. The alias is the most important info - channel commands are performed with "<alias>/<command>" - for example, pub/on to join the public channel.
* '''+channel <name>''' - get more info about a channel.
* We'll use the Public channel for the rest of our commands:
** '''pub/on''' - join the channel
** '''pub <text>''' - say something on the channel
** '''pub/off''' - leave the channel
** '''pub/mute''' - mute the channel (does not work for wizards)
** '''pub/unmute''' - unmute the channel
** '''pub/emit''' - emit to the channel (your name will be logged)
** '''pub/last''' - view the last 10 messages on the channel
** '''pub/who''' - see who's on the channel
* Some channels require a password:
** '''pub/password <password>''' - join a channel with a password
* Sometimes channel aliases get weird and need to be reset:
** '''+channel/fix''' - fix your channel aliases.
