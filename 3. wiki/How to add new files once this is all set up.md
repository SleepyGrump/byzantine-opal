# How to create new news files

Show this to staffers or players who you'll be having create News files on your wiki.

The process is the same for Help files, just replace all instances of "News" with "Help" or whatever your help category name is.

## Starting a new category

```text
1. Go to <your wiki>/Category:<new category name> - be careful not to use the same name as a news file you would later like to use.
2. Put in just this text: [[Category:News]]
3. Include the new category in a new news file.

List of current categories (like Policies, House Rules, etc):
    <your list here>

```

## Writing a new News file

```text
1. Go to <your wiki>/Category:News
2. Type the topic name. Keep it punchy, don't start it with 'The' or 'A'. Don't use a category name for a file name.
3. You'll be taken to a News template page.
4. Fill out as much as you can and skip what doesn't make sense:
    topic=Title
    short=The punchy quick sub-header text or TLDR.
    detail=The main body of the entry. Keep it short or break it into multiple files.
    links=The names of other news files.
    categories=News category this belongs in.

Notes:
    - Keep it simple - avoid HTML and fancy visual tricks. Tables will not translate.
    - Use bold and italics where you'd normally use <code> or the like.
    - Links do work and if they don't, tell me.
    - <br /> works better than line breaks sometimes depending on how you've laid out the template.
    - # (wiki numbers) work but if you use them, every # in the file will be interpreted as a number.
    - * bullets work out to *** 3 bullets. I can add more if needed.
    - Keep it short - more than 8000 characters will fail.
    - Split topics into multiple pages. (File2, File3, etc.)
    - Check each file you create on the MU* using "news <file name>".
    - If you run across something you want to work that doesn't, tell me.
