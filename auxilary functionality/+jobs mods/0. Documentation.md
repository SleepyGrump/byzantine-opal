## Installation

### If you already have +jobs installed

* These mods will work just fine for you.

* If you're interested, the file `Modified +jobs install.mu` includes job logging to a file on the server, plus a few other chanages. You definitely don't need those in order for these mods to work.

### If you don't have +jobs installed

1. Install `Modified +jobs install.mu`.
2. Pick and choose the mods you want to include.

### Configuration

See each individual file for info on configuration.

### Warnings and disclaimers

I haven't tested this stuff on RhostMUSH, Penn, etc, just MUX.

## Notes for potential future mods

* Right now, +jobs uses priority 1 for green and priority 3 for red. That's bass-ackwards. Maybe I need to convert it.

* Think about how to make a comment to a job WITHOUT mailing it, but still making the comment public to the player.

* Consider letting players +job/query one another.

* Get all uses of player name to use player moniker first.
