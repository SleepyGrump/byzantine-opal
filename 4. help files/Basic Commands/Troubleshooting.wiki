|detail=Sometimes things will get broken in ways that don't make sense. Here are some commands to help fix them.
|example=
* '''+channel/fix''' - fix your aliases. When you have trouble logging into some channels, sometimes a reset is called for.
* '''+selfboot''' - if you show up in the +who twice, this can boot one of your dead connections.
* '''+width <#>''' - set your width to a specific number between 48 and 200. This can help if the display looks too narrow sometimes. Experiment and see what works best for you! '''+width -''' to unset.
* '''+name <text>''' - find names starting with <text>. Names can get taken by someone else if players don't log in for 45 days. Use +name to find your old name so you can log in again and pick a new name, to find a new name, or to see who has a name similar to yours.
* '''+sweep''' - sweep disconnected players out of your room. Only works if you own the room.
* '''+beep''' - test your client's beep function.
* '''+block <name>''' - block someone from communicating with you via page.
