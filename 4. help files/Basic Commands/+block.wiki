|detail=If a player is giving you OOC trouble of any kind, you can +block them. This prevents them from contacting you via page. It doesn't prevent them from using msg to send you an IC message, so be sure to use '''msg/block <player>''' if you want to block them there as well.
|example=
* '''+block <name>''' - block a player from paging you.
* '''+block all''' - block everybody from paging you.
* '''+unblock <name>''' - unblock them.
* '''+block/clear''' - clear all blocks.
* '''+block/who''' - see who you're blocking.
* '''+whitelist <name>''' - allow someone to page you even when you're blocking everyone.
* '''+blacklist <name>''' - remove someone from your whitelist.
* '''+whitelist/clear''' - remove everyone from your whitelist.
