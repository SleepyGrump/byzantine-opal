{{help
|topic=+request
|detail=+request is a way of asking for help. All requests go to staff.
|example=
* '''req/help''' - see a list of request types.
* '''req/<type> <title>=<text>''' - create a request of <type>. Types are important - they help staff prioritize your request correctly and assign it to the place it needs to go.
* '''+request <title>=<text>''' - if you're not sure what kind of request to make it, a general request is fine. Give it a title and provide enough information that staff can figure out what you need.
